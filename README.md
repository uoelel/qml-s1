# QML - Summative Assessment 1

**DUE Week 8 - Thu 9 November at noon**

This repository contains the code and data you'll need for completing the first summative assessment for QML.

## How to download and get started 

1. Click on the green "Code" button above > Download ZIP.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Double-click on `qml-s1.Rproj` to open the RStudio Project.
4. From the "Files" tab in RStudio, open `code/analysis.Rmd`. This file contains everything you'll need to complete the assignment.

**Note that this is how you should always be opening your files!**

Opening the project first, rather than the Rmd file, ensures that relative paths to the data will work the way we expect them to.
If you've been having problems with relative paths in the past, then this may be why.


## How to submit

1. Render the Rmd file to PDF.
2. Rename the PDF file to your exam number only.
3. Upload the PDF file to Learn.


## How to ask questions

Questions about anything assessment-related will only be addressed if they are posted on Piazza.
This ensures that everyone has access to the same information.
