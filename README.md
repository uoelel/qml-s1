# QML - Formative Assessment 1

**DUE Week 5 - Thu 19 October at noon**

This repository contains the code and data you'll need for completing the first formative assessment for QML.

This formative has a similar structure and type of exercises that you will be required to complete for the first summative assessment, so this is a great opportunity for you to practice.

For this formative assessment, you will not receive individual feedback, but a model answer with general comments will be shared after the submission deadline. You can of course come to office hours if you want to discuss your submission.


## How to download and get started 

1. Click on the green "Code" button above > Download ZIP.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Double-click on `qml-f1.Rproj` to open the RStudio Project.
4. From the "Files" tab in RStudio, open `code/analysis.Rmd`. This file contains everything you'll need to complete the assignment.

**Note that this is how you should always be opening your files!**

Opening the project first, rather than the Rmd file, ensures that relative paths to the data will work the way we expect them to.
If you've been having problems with relative paths in the past, then this may be why.


## How to submit

1. Render the Rmd file to PDF.
2. Rename the PDF file to your exam number only.
3. Upload the PDF file to Learn.


## How to ask questions

Questions about anything assessment-related will only be addressed if they are posted on Piazza.
This ensures that everyone has access to all the same information.
